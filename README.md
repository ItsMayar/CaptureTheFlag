<h1>Capture the Flag (CTF)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Capture the Flag (CTF) is a strategic cybersecurity competition where participants aim to discover and retrieve hidden text strings, known as "flags," embedded within intentionally vulnerable systems, applications, or websites. These competitions are designed to challenge and enhance skills across various domains of ethical hacking and information security, including the utilization of tools like Kali Linux, and techniques such as QR code exploitation, cryptography, steganography, buffer overflow attacks, reverse engineering, digital forensics, and other advanced methodologies. CTF events serve both educational and competitive purposes, providing hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.
